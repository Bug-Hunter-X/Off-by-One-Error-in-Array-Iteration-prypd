This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java and its solution. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with the for loop modified to avoid this issue.
